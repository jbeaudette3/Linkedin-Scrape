# Linkedin-Scrape
Scrape using python requests and beautiful soup, organized with pandas dataframe

Job searching is frustrating, especially when some companies spam the job boards to appear at the top of the list.

This was written with the intent to find these types of companies and filter them out; who posts the most and who 
posts the least.
 
Additionally, this aggregates your keywords (5 max) and finds the most common titles of how companies will list their job titles.

Seeing only 25 listings at a time works, but takes too long to find anything good. How about 500 posts with corresponding links
direct to the job posting and to the company? See a quick snippet about the company, and their location.
This filers direct to Chicago, IL, and also includes any opportunities listed as remote.

Please, don't spam.
